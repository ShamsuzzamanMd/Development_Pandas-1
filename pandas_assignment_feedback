Panda Assignment 2 Review

The whole assignment seems to be perfect, they have use more different ways to solve the solution than us, like ‘str.contains()’.
They have used chipo_price10=(chipo['item_price']>10).sum()
to find the values which has costed more than 10 dollars, whereas we have   used .count().

Other than this think the whole code seems to be perfect.

They can look at the step 4 and 8 to make it more concise.
